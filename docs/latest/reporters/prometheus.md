Exposing Metrics for Prometheus
===============================

Prometheus is an open source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It has a dimensional data model, a really powerful and
flexible query language and one very important difference in comparison with all other Kamon reporters: data has to be
pulled out of your application instead of pushed to external servers.

This module exposes a scraping endpoint with all Kamon metrics in the Prometheus text format, all you will have to do
after starting this module is add the target to your Prometheus server and start enjoying the awesomeness.


## Installation

{% include dependency-info.html module="kamon-prometheus" version=site.data.versions.latest.prometheus %}

Once the reporter is on your classpath it will be automatically picked up by Kamon. When your application starts, you
can go to <http://localhost:9095/metrics> to see your exposed metrics.


## Configuration

The default configuration is enough to get you started exporting metrics, but you are very likely to need tweaking the
default bucketing configuration. Long story short, this module has to take the high definition data captured by Kamon
and aggregate it into a reasonable number of buckets before exposing it to Prometheus, and the better you choose your
buckets the more useful the data you can get out of Prometheus.

It is very important that you iterate on your buckets configuration to find the right tradeoff between granularity and
number a reasonable number of exposed time series per metric (each bucket ends up being a separate time serie in
Prometheus). The quality of the percentiles you get is greatly influenced by your bucketing configuration, take some
time to think it through!

{% code_block hcl %}
kamon.prometheus.buckets {
    default-buckets = [
      10,
      30,
      100,
      300,
      1000,
      3000,
      10000,
      30000,
      100000
    ]

    time-buckets = [
      0.005,
      0.01,
      0.025,
      0.05,
      0.075,
      0.1,
      0.25,
      0.5,
      0.75,
      1,
      2.5,
      5,
      7.5,
      10
    ]

    information-buckets = [
      512,
      1024,
      2048,
      4096,
      16384,
      65536,
      524288,
      1048576
    ]
  }
{% endcode_block scala %}

The measurement unit on each metric will dictate which bucketing configuration applies:
  - `time-buckets` for metrics with a unit in the time dimension. Everything is scaled to seconds.
  - `information-buckets` for all units in the information dimension. Everything is scaled to bytes.
  - `default-buckets` are used when there is no measurement unit information in a metric.

## Sending environment tags to Prometheus

It is possible to provide custom tags in `application.conf` by providing `kamon.environment.tags`
with the value you wish to set.

```
kamon.environment.tags {
  custom1 = "test1"
  env = staging
}
```

To enable the Prometheus reporter to use these values within your application metrics, you have to enable
the `include-environment-tags` in your `kamon.prometheus` configuration:

```
kamon.prometheus {
  include-environment-tags = true
  embedded-server {
    hostname = 0.0.0.0
    port = 9095
  }
}
```
