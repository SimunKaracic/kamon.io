Akka Instrumentation
====================

Overview
--------

Kamon supports instrumenting Akka 2.4 and Akka 2.5 and bring all of these features out of the box:

* __[Metrics collection][metrics]__: Metrics for actor systems, actors, routers, dispatchers and actor groups, as well
  as remoting/cluster components of the actor system.
* __[Message Tracing][tracing]__: The instrumentation can automatically generate spans out of messages processed by
  selected actors in the system.
* __[Context Propagation][context]__: Ensure that  Context gets propagated across actor messages sent to both local and
  remote actors.
* __[Ask Pattern Timeout Warning][ask-pattern-warning]__: An utility that logs a warning with additional information when
  a usage of the Ask Pattern times out.
